        The SSL socket object provides the same interface
        as the socket interface but behaves differently.

        When data is sent over a SSL connection
        more data may be read than was requested from by
        the miniws4py websocket object.

        In that case, the data may have been indeed read
        from the underlying real socket, but not read by the
        application which will expect another trigger from the
        manager's polling mechanism as if more data was still on the
        wire. This will happen only when new data is
        sent by the other peer which means there will be
        some delay before the initial read data is handled
        by the application.

        Due to this, we have to rely on a non-public method
        to query the internal SSL socket buffer if it has indeed
        more data pending in its buffer.

        Now, some people in the Python community
        `discourage <https://bugs.python.org/issue21430>`_
        this usage of the ``pending()`` method because it's not
        the right way of dealing with such use case. They advise
        `this approach <https://docs.python.org/dev/library/ssl.html#notes-on-non-blocking-sockets>`_
        instead. Unfortunately, this applies only if the
        application can directly control the poller which is not
        the case with the WebSocket abstraction here.

        We therefore rely on this `technic <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3187565/select-and-ssl-in-python>`_
        which seems to be valid anyway.

        This is a bit of a shame because we have to process
